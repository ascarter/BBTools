BBTools is a collection of scripts and extensions for BBEdit

The project contains helpful tools collected from using BBEdit for well over ten years. The tools fall into a couple general forms:

* Color Schemes - BBEdit color schemes (some slightly modified from defaults)
* Scripts - useful scripts for interacting with BBEdit and generally extending it
* Text Filters - Useful general purpose text filters

## Requirements

* [BBEdit](http://barebones.com/products/bbedit) 11.1 or greater
* Mac OS X 10.10 or greater
* [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) 2.0 or greater (default on Mac OS X)

## Install

    rake install

## Uninstall

    rake uninstall

## Customize

The best way to extend BBTools for your own use is to clone in GitHub and start adding your own items. The `Rakefile` is generally designed to read all files added so you may be able to easily add your own items.
